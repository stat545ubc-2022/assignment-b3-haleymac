# Vancouver Trees Shiny App

**For this assignment I have chosen option B and have created my own
shiny app**

This repository contains the source code for a shiny app that allows a
user to explore the vancouver trees dataset through several interactive
features, including a coordinate plot and a customizable table.

A running instance of the shiny app can be found at:

<https://haleymac.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-haleymac/?_ga=2.66325866.536963578.1669247330-1308323073.1669247330>

The dataset used to create this app is the vancouver_trees dataset,
which can be found as part of the ‘datateachr’ package, or alternatively
can be downloaded from
<https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/download/?format=csv&timezone=America/Los_Angeles&lang=en&use_labels_for_header=true&csv_separator=%3B>
Several modifications to the dataset were made using the dplyr package,
and can be found in the beginning of the source code presented in this
repository.
